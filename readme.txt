Running the program:
First, initiate the server with the command:
    'python3 server.py'
Then, initiate the client with the command:
    'python3 client.py'

Follow the instructions within the command line. Anything that does not follow the expected pattern will alert you and prompt you to reenter information
If an invalid dollar amount is entered, it will alert you and then prompt you to reenter what you would like to do.

To close the client, it is best to use 'exit' in command line.

When exiting both programs, type 'close' into the client and the server will close as well.
You may leave the server running while exiting the client.
Note that exiting server first will allow client to run until a message would be sent to server (will still take 1-2 inputs before exiting).
